# 🔥 nusaibSec Recon Automator
**From Manual to Fully Automated: The Ultimate Bug Bounty Recon Script**

Stop wasting hours running individual commands and organizing text files! **nusaibSec Recon Automator** converts a massive, tedious manual Bug Bounty reconnaissance methodology into a single, highly optimized Bash script. Just run the script, and it will do all the heavy lifting, creating a neatly organized folder with all the hackable data right in front of you.

## 🚀 Features & The 7-Phase Pipeline

This script chains together the best tools in the industry to create a flawless pipeline:

* **Phase 1: Lightning-Fast Passive Mapping** - Gathers thousands of subdomains passively using APIs (Subfinder, Assetfinder, Chaos).
* **Phase 2: DNS Resolution** - Filters out the noise and drops offline assets using `dnsx` to keep only the "Alive" targets.
* **Phase 3: Infrastructure & Port Analysis** - Blazing-fast top 100 port scan with `naabu`, dynamically triggering `nmap` (-sV -sC) on discovered open ports.
* **Phase 4: Web Probing & Vuln Scanning** - Probes for live web apps with `httpx` and hunts for quick-win Subdomain Takeovers using `subzy`.
* **Phase 5: Deep Crawling & JS Extraction** - Launches `katana` to deeply crawl websites, automatically extracting `.js` files and sensitive extensions (`.xml`, `.bak`, `.sql`, etc.).
* **Phase 6: Automated Parameter Mining** - Cleans duplicate URLs with `uro` and feeds them into `gxss` to hand you a final list of reflected parameters primed for XSS and SQLi testing.
* **Phase 7: The Background Heavy Lifters** - Secretly runs heavy, time-consuming tools (`asnmap`, `amass`, `oneforall`) in the background while you hack the fast results.
